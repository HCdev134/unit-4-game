# unit-4-game
unit 4 jquery, #3 event(s) and getting these just right literally held me up this long from getting an above 90

a bit of confusion on that, at the point of anxiety trying to write this in text at this point. 
to the point of where i write these digressions because i think being understood can go a long way. 
i'm like our charismatic advanced guys and have the same drive and work ability, just haven't come out of my shell yet, so maybe understanding and talking can help. 

i've tried this assignment alone over 100 times (when not copying code) see: never be a script kiddie(text, WHICH IS > better expanded upon and explained, 
 and how that helped me, and will help me in the long term" 
this assignment = both the JS#3 and the jQuery#4 


have tried to write about it articulately over the last week, and have come to some conclusions about that, and would like to get TAs opinions on that.  If thats even worth it by now? because if not i just want to be as least of burden as possible, and don't want it to seem like i'm asking too much. ),
NOT THE BEGINNER CONCEPTS OR SURFACE LEVEL CONCEPTS THAT ARE BLOCKERS, ITS THE ADVANCED STUFF. AND YES I READ:) HOPE WE CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THAT MAYBE

disclaimers are added because of a certain paradox i can explain 

would be a good nuanced talk to have in person. 

Not going to be over the top about it(and have never tried to be, but have kind of feared that (relates to the whole wanting to fit in and do good around people that i look up to in a sense)), just looking for a way to figure it out, as always. 

More imporantly , On handling bootcamp and cirriculum efficiently, and things i've learned with code 

See: most imortant thing i've picked up on this.  finish required first, understand required (vs "confusion about 90 and above" and THEN use the other time to ask any non topic related questions) <--- Can expand and explain in person. <  
because of that: see: how i wanted to present a really good assignment because the TAs and instructors are cool people that i wanted to make some kind of good impression upon (please don't put in different context)
also 2nd most: organization and presenting questions 
runner up: hope the TAs can like me, hope we can talk, this is just a temporary repo anyway right? 
or not necessarily a "production" repo? 

from OSint i know how to make non-related accounts on things pretty quickly , 
or should this be taken as an actual production portfolio? 

if so, can create another more official repo with an actual name. 
Plan was, once really established, to migrate these projects(their more "finished" counter parts as i continue to study and learn enough to do them in "my own way" even if i may have to abandon that for the sake of time now<_-------------- ***<!important>*** )

or, to add my own take, i'm pretty good at creating new accounts and making them "production worthy," and these have been the best learning experiences along the way

goodQuestion(for my own google: that would be silly to ask that because i can google it, and i have Text that differentiates and shows how those ARE NOT the questions i am trying to ask.

  See: 5index-comms: Block vs Blocker vs "understanding a search fu concept and conveying my understanding has evolved and that 'i understand this' to others"): can you use unicode or any of those character variations in `readme.md` files or just plain `.md` files
