3. SEARCH STRINGS : (REMOVED OTHER DATA, ALSO A QUESTION IN ITSELF/FOR MYSELF, WHAT AND WHY GOOGLE ADDS TO YOUR SEARCH STRING, AND IS IT YOUR BROSER INFO? HAVE SEEN PROPERTIES LIKE LOCATION="STRING OF NUMBERS" ETC. ETC. )
random(ignore, except for the understanding the googling part )
3.5 (COMMON PROPERTIES IVE SEEN ARE &VED= )(HMMM I WONDER WHAT I WOULD DO IN THAT CASE?  OR MAYBE SOMETIMES THOSE THINGS ARE PRETTY ABSTRACT AND IT HELPS TO HAVE GUIDANCE.  PAY FOR GUIDANCE=wrong P4P P4C LELTRIL DMSwit)(words like that are UDL, we live in the age of pshycological hacking, and in my case, the only thing that threw physical attacks off was psychological misdirection.  so stuff like that interests me, but i'll keep it to myself)
